# Keyboard Light Composer

I bought an RGB lighty colory pretty keyboard(y) that looks awesome! But the manufacturers driver only provides 3 cool effects. And the effects aren't as customizable as I would like them to be :(
So I wanted to create a Desktop application (JavaFx) that provides an easy framework to create new effects for RGB keyboards of different manufacturers.

### Planned features
  * Effects that are customizable using properties
  * Properties should be bindable to any kind of custom provider (e.g. get a double value from CPU usage)
  * Effectlayers and Effectgroups (folders)
  * * Effect layers should be mappable on the keyboard as you like
  * Online effect repository
