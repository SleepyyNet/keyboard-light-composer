# Keyboard Light Composer

I bought an RGB lighty colory pretty keyboard(y) that looks awesome! But the manufacturers driver only provides 3 cool effects. And the effects aren't as customizable as I would like them to be :(
So I wanted to create a Desktop application (JavaFx) that provides an easy framework to create new effects for RGB keyboards of different manufacturers.

### Features
  * Effects are customizable using properties
  * Using "ValueStrategies" property values can be obtained using any algorithm (e.g. CPU Usage)
  * You may arrange effects in layers as you wish and group them in effectgroups

### Planned features
  * Effect layers can be mapped to the keyboard and resized (not yet implemented)
  * Online effect repository
